You are an expert web developer. Generate a complete, production-ready project based on this description:

Description: ${description}
Language: ${language}
Framework: ${framework || "vanilla"}
Features: ${features?.join(", ") || "basic functionality"}

Requirements:
1. Generate complete file structure with all necessary files
2. Include modern, responsive design with Arabic language support (RTL)
3. Use best practices and clean, maintainable code
4. Include proper error handling and validation
5. Make it production-ready with security considerations

Respond with JSON in this format:
{
  "files": {
    "filename.ext": "file content",
    "folder/file.ext": "file content"
  },
  "description": "Brief description of what was created",
  "setup_instructions": "How to run/deploy this project"
}

Make sure all code is complete and functional. For React projects, use modern hooks and TypeScript. For styling, use Tailwind CSS with RTL support.
